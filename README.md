# Reinforcement-Learning Platform (Qt Edition)

A comprehensive, **PyTorch-based** reinforcement learning (RL) playground with a Qt graphical front-end.  
Train, visualize and compare classic and modern RL algorithms on discrete and continuous control tasks, all from one intuitive GUI.

## ✨ Key Features

| Category | Details |
|----------|---------|
| Algorithms | **SARSA, DQN, PPO, A2C, DDPG** (plug-in architecture—add your own easily) |
| Environments | • Custom Maze <br>• `CartPole-v0` <br>• `Pendulum-v1` <br>• Quickly register new Gym-style environments |
| Visualisation | Real-time environment animation, reward / loss curves, parameter dashboards |
| Front-end | **Qt (PyQt / PySide)**—native desktop look & feel |
| Extensibility | Modular folders: `agents/`, `algorithms/`, `trainer/`, `utils/` |
| Reproducibility | Auto-save checkpoints, TensorBoard logs, YAML configs |

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/your-org/rl-qt-platform.git
cd rl-qt-platform

# 2. Create Python 3.9 environment (recommended)
conda create -n rl-qt python=3.9
conda activate rl-qt

# 3. Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or minimal CPU-only install
# pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu

# 4. Run the app  🚀
python app.py
```

The main window will open, showing:
1. Environment selector  
2. Algorithm & hyper-parameter panel  
3. Live simulation canvas  
4. Training curves

Click **Start** to begin training; parameters can be tweaked on-the-fly.

## 🛠️ Adding a New Environment

1. Subclass `gym.Env` or follow the Maze template in `envs/`.
2. Register it in `envs/__init__.py`.
3. The GUI will auto-detect and list it in the **Environment** dropdown on the next start-up.
